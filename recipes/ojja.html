        <li>Cover the bottom of a frying pan or saute pan with oil.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and onions and saute until fragrant and starting to soften.</li>
        <li>Add green onions, tomatoes, chilli peppers, parsley, salt, harissa, dried chillies, and paprika and continue to saute on medium heat until softened.</li>
        <li>Add half a cup of water and mix well. At this point the mixture should be a little thick but still a bit liquidy.</li>
        <li>Crack your eggs on top of the mixture, far enough apart that they don't touch each other. Season each egg with salt and black pepper. Cover and let cookuntil whites are set and the yolk is slightly runny (or to desired doneness) and remove from heat. </li>
